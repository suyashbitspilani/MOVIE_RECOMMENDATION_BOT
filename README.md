# Movie Chatbot Based on Graph DataBase and Vector DataBase
I used Neo4J,OpenAI,OnpenEmbeddings,Langchain to build this Project   
The main idea that I want to convey through this project is efficient Retrival from Graph DataBase and Semantic Search
# Future Developments  
- Using Unstructured data as input and store it in a Graph DB
- use of open source Models,Embeddinngs
# Usage

- clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/debrupf2946/Movie_GraphSerch_Chatbot`

Set OpenAI API KEY by

2. `mkdir secret.toml` file
3. Write the nessecory API keys as per Project requiremnets in secret.toml file
